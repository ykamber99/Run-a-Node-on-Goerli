## 📝 Intro:
Here is a breif summary of how to configure an execution & beacon node & validator on Goerli Testnet. This repo also serves as an conclusion for the Fintech-565 Advanced Blockchain midterm and hope to provide some help for friends that are not an expert in Linux system. Thanks for my friends Lucy, Wanting, Ruofan,Adam, Tieyan🧙🏻‍♀️ and "bosses" 👨🏻‍⚖️ from Foresight News who continuously help me during the "hopeless" configuration.
